## Education
    Currently(2021/3/31) I a junior at UCSD pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Bioenegineering - Bioinformatics. I have been developing 
    my knowledge in Biology, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Chemistry, and Computer Science. This school year, my courses focused 
    on expanding my programming and algorithm design knowledge and experiences, for example, in Next-Gen-Sequencing (NSG) algorithms 
    including DNA origin folk discovery, DNA alignment and assembly, and RNA alignments. This Spring, I am taking intro to Software 
    Development, and this index page is lab1 and the first step of my SE journey!

## Research
    I have commited to Subramaniam's Lab at UCSD for over 2 years now, during which me and my team applied multiomics methods to study 
    Zinc Finger Proteins (ZNF) transcription factors' and chromatin modifiers' effect in human ubilical vein cells in oscillatory 
    stress (OS), associated with an atheroprone endothelial phenotype, and pulsatile stress (PS), associated with atheroprotective 
    endothelial phenotype. We've also started to create a database for documenting associations ZNF transcription factors/chromatin
    modifiers have with genes based on GEO database and MACS2. 

## Random
    My favorite day of a week is Sunday. I used to hate Sunday as a kid, as the next day is Monday when school starts again. However, 
    after college, I tried to finish most of the work before Sunday noon (does not work our from time to time smh), so I enjoyed 
    Sunday afternoon doing something new, or just chilling with a TV series or a movie.
